#####Explain the goals of your project.


With larger cancer research organizations - a donors money is going to a black box. People do not know whose lives they're impacting - making them less likely  to donate. The goal of this visualization would be to help the public make more targeted tangible donations. What geographic regons in the US need more funding for cancer care? What age group or disease type needs more funding?




#####Detail the data sources you intend to use, and explain how you intend to search for data if you have not identified them.
I am considering using the data sets available online national cancer databases that collect cancer data statistics across the US.

 I would like to find data on how many clinical trials are available for each age group/location from clinicaltrials.gov, but I'm having a hard time finding it. I'll continue researching online for public datasets.

#####Identify the questions you wish to address.
- How many adults, adolescents, and children get diagnosed with cancer per year? How does this compare to the number of deaths per year? 
- What are specific cancers that have a higher mortality rate within each age group or location?
- How many clinical trials are available in the area?



#####Building from these questions, provide an initial outline of how you intend the visualize the data, describing the charts/maps you are considering.
I want to compare different cancer statistics in childhood, adolescen, and young adult cancer.

This would involve creating an interactive visualization with filters for the different variables: age group, new cancer cases per 100,000, cancer deaths per 100,000, type of cancer, and total # of clinical trials by state.

I'm exploring different design directions for the type of graph:
- Interactive map using diverging color scheme to compare where people are most and least affected by cancer.
- A stacked bar chart, showing ratios of types of cancer amongst each age group  (Ex: 1-4 year old, bar composition would be made up of 15 most common cancers)
