#####Explain the goals of your project.


Young adults with cancer are often overlooked because theyâ€™re between pediatric and adult cancer, even though cancer is 6 times more likely in adolescents and young adults than it is in children. Many larger cancer organizations do not provide young adult direct patient services or reseearch funding. Thus, the survivorship and support needs of this age group are the least studied and funded - often leading to a delayed diagnosis and lower quality of care. 

The goal of this visualization would be to help cancer researchers decide where funding should be allocated for future cancer research by analyzing cancer trends among common specific age groups.





#####Detail the data sources you intend to use, and explain how you intend to search for data if you have not identified them.
I am considering using the data sets available online national cancer databases that collect cancer data statistics across the US.

 I would like to find data on funding for young adults and children cancer research, but I'm having a hard time finding it. I'll continue researching online for public datasets.

#####Identify the questions you wish to address.
- How many young adults and children get diagnosed with cancer diagnosis per year? How does this compare to the number of deaths per year? 
- What are specific cancers that have a higher mortality rate in young adults than children? 
- What are specific cancers that have a higher diagnosis rate in young adults than children?
- How is funding currently distributed for children versus young adults? 



#####Building from these questions, provide an initial outline of how you intend the visualize the data, describing the charts/maps you are considering.
I want to compare different cancer statistics in both young adults and children. 

This would involve creating an interactive visualization with filters for the different variables: age group, new cancer cases per 100,000, cancer deaths per 100,000, type of cancer.

I'm exploring different design directions for type of graph:
- A stacked bar chart, showing ratios of types of cancer amongst each age group  (Ex: 1-4 year old, bar composition would be made up of 15 most common cancers)
